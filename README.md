# Youtube-Optimization-Analysis
Everyone uses YouTube across all ages. From kids looking up paw patrol, women searching for hair tutorials, and guys debating sports clips, YouTube has become a common place of interest that attracts people from all over. With so many people coming to one place, that leaves a lot of data available that can open doors to new possibilities. That is why Iâ€™ve chosen to explore a dataset that contains over 2,000 YouTube videos and comments to see which keywords bring in the most traffic.

# ASK
* What are the most commented-upon videos? Or the most liked?
* How many total views does each category have? How many likes?
* What are the most-liked comments?

   _Measurable questions can help us gain a numeric answer, and help establish the popularity of different ideas_

* What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
* How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?

  _Gaining insight to a customer's mindset can explain their interests and give them useful recommendations_

We will be using a youtube dataset that is available to the public with a no copyright license [(CC0 1.0 universal public domain)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 
* 2 CSV files
* It spans over 2 data tables containing over 18,000 + rows each,  one detailing data on the comments and the other consisting of stats. 
* Videos dates spanning from 2007 - 2022, and collected using Youtubes data API. 
* Comprehensive metrics measured such as likes, views, comments, and keyword categories.
* Dislikes were not included in this data.

_Exploring this information can help in collecting data to support the direction a company wants to go whether it be in marketing, business, or anyone wanting to see the public's view._

# Process

**Excel**

* Checked for duplicates, empty spaces, and spelling errors.

   _First I used excel to check for duplicates, and empty spaces which it was free of. The tricky part came down to the comments because it had spelling errors, but I chose to leave them be since people communicate differently._

* Utilized power query to reformat the unicode so symbols and emojis were readable.

   _Learning their phrases, symbols, and code words is very important to understanding your audience. In order to translate the symbols and emojis I had to reformat the unicode back into excel because the first upload had them untranscribable._

 **SQL**
 
_In SQL I wanted to answer the questions that I asked above in order to gain an understanding of my explorations. Using commands such as order by, group by, where, and left join helped me sift through different information to see what exactly was going on._
  *  Most Commented videos, keyword Categories, Joined Table, Average Sentiment score are some of the ideas measured.

_Joining the tables using a column they both had allowed me to see them side by side at once and allowed for my code to be shorter and easier to read. Using where allowed me to identify specifics, and count allowed me to get a number that could identify the popularity of certain metrics._

# Analyze

## Summary:

 The main idea I wanted to understand was the popularity of the youtube videos because they told me what people were willing to spend their time on. Observing the views, likes, and comments was a direct response from the consumers and the data there holds answers to numerous possibilities.

**Most Commented Videos**

The most commemted showed what captured viewers attention the most and gave insight about their thoughts on the video
 ```
--Most commented videos
SELECT Title, Comments
FROM `stoked-grin-387603.youtube.stats`
Order BY Comments DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Most Liked Video**

The likes can be seen as instant positive feedback, showing that viewers would'nt mind this video being saved to their liked playlist, and how Youtube can better optimize their algorithm.
```
--Most liked videos
SELECT Title, Likes
FROM `stoked-grin-387603.youtube.stats`
Order BY Likes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Most Viewed Keyword**

The most viewed keywords showed what was involved in searching for their desired video. This revealed that google was seen the most with over 46 billion views, showcasing its importance in searches.

```
--Keyword views
SELECT Keyword, SUM(Views) as View_num
FROM `stoked-grin-387603.youtube.stats`
GROUP BY Keyword
Order BY View_num DESC;
```

**Most liked Keyword**

The most liked keywords was a collection of the likes spread across different videos that included certain keywords. Such as the mr.beast being involved in multiple videos and those videos he was involved in generated over 1 billion likes.
```

FROM `stoked-grin-387603.youtube.stats`
GROUP BY Keyword
Order BY like_num DESC;
```

**Top liked Comments**

The most commented keywords was a collection of comments spread across different videos that included keywords. This also had mr.beast as the main traffick generator taking 8/10 of the top liked comments.
