# Youtube-Optimization-Analysis
Everyone uses YouTube across all ages. From kids looking up paw patrol, women searching for hair tutorials, and guys debating sports clips, YouTube has become a common place of interest that attracts people from all over. With so many people coming to one place, that leaves a lot of data available that can open doors to new possibilities. That is why Iâ€™ve chosen to explore a dataset that contains over 2,000 YouTube videos and comments to see if which keywords bring in the most traffic.

Measurable questions can help us gain a numeric answer, and help establish the popularity of different ideas.

What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?
Gaining insight to a customer's mindset can explain their interests and give them useful recommendations.
