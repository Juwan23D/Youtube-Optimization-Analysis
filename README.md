# Youtube-Optimization-Analysis
Everyone uses YouTube across all ages. From kids looking up paw patrol, women searching for hair tutorials, and guys debating sports clips, YouTube has become a common place of interest that attracts people from all over. With so many people coming to one place, that leaves a lot of data available that can open doors to new possibilities. That is why Iâ€™ve chosen to explore a dataset that contains over 2,000 YouTube videos and comments to see if which keywords bring in the most traffic.
