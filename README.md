# Youtube-Optimization-Analysis
Everyone uses YouTube across all ages. From kids looking up paw patrol, women searching for hair tutorials, and guys debating sports clips, YouTube has become a common place of interest that attracts people from all over. With so many people coming to one place, that leaves a lot of data available that can open doors to new possibilities. That is why Iâ€™ve chosen to explore a dataset that contains over 2,000 YouTube videos and comments to see which keywords bring in the most traffic.

# ASK
* What are the most commented-upon videos? Or the most liked?
* How many total views does each category have? How many likes?
* What are the most-liked comments?

   _Measurable questions can help us gain a numeric answer, and help establish the popularity of different ideas_

* What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
* How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?

  _Gaining insight to a customer's mindset can explain their interests and give them useful recommendations_
